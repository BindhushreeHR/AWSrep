The Harry Potter series is so rich in detail and intricately crafted that every time we revisit it we find new things to appreciate. Seeds were sown from the start, so let’s take a look at the first chapter of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, ‘The Boy Who Lived’, and see if there’s anything new to discover…

 

Philosopher’s Stone kicks off with a description of the Dursleys and their general judgemental view of the world. Vernon goes off to work, Petunia tends to baby Dudley and between the three of them they manage to criticise a great number of people – particularly the overjoyed wizards celebrating the demise of Voldemort. Not that they know that.
When Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull, grey Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country.
